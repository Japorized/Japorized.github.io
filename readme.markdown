### { Personal } Jekyll Theme

Big thanks to [{ PannosSakkos }](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) to have created this theme.
I have since changed the CSS framework of the site to use WingCSS instead of Twitter Bootstrap, and have since not followed the development of the theme developed by PannosSakkos.

### Special thanks to these sources
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) for awesome icons
* Eduardo Boucas (@eduardoboucas) for the inspiration on Ajaxifying the Blog Index Page
* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for parsing LaTeX in HTML
* [Featherlight](http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/) as the light lightbox plugin
* [Loaders.css](https://connoratherton.com/loaders) for the pure css Pacman loader <3
* [FitText](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js) auto-scaling the font size for the first blog post
* [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com) for the masonry layout and methods


### Future plans (More like a potential list of TODO)
* Remove single pages for math proofs. Will replace with PDF links instead. To simplify work, create an HTML in _includes to take in the raw link for the PDF from the TeX repo, and use the workaround so that the PDF opens up as a new tab with a better view on Google (rather than on the Github display).
* Modify the <hr> into something nicer... A white straight line looks out of place.
* <strike>Make it possible to put images stretches across the viewport in blog posts</strike>. Apparently there is no way to work around this in the current environment.
