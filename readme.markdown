### { Personal } Jekyll Theme

Big thanks to [{ PannosSakkos }](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) to have created this theme.

### Special thanks to these sources
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) for awesome icons
* Eduardo Boucas (@eduardoboucas) for the inspiration on Ajaxifying the Blog Index Page
* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for parsing LaTeX
* [Featherlight](http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/) as the light lightbox plugin
* [Loaders.css](https://connoratherton.com/loaders) for the pure css Pacman loader <3

### Future plans
* Remove single pages for math proofs. Will replace with PDF links instead. To simplify work, create an HTML in _includes to take in the raw link for the PDF from the TeX repo, and use the workaround so that the PDF opens up as a new tab with a better view on Google (rather than on the Github display).
