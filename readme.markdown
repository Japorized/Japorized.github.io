### { Personal } Jekyll Theme

Big thanks to [{ PannosSakkos }](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) to have created this theme.
I have since changed the CSS framework of the site to use WingCSS instead of Twitter Bootstrap, and have since not followed the development of the theme under by PannosSakkos.
