### Hi there!

I'm Johnson. Welcome onto my blog called Japorized, a pseunonym that I go by online. And I shall continue to use the name cause it is already my identity, at least in the cyber world.

I am currently 22, and I am pursuing an undergraduate degree with a major in Pure Mathematics and a minor in Actuarial Science, matriculating at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada. Prior to this, I have studied in Sunway University, in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, under the American Degree Transfer Program.

I have a passion for mathematics, both in its purest form and its some of its applications. I like knowing how things work at its very fundamental, perhaps just to satisfy the forever-unquenchable needs of my inquisitional mind.

I also love programming and designing, and I have cooperated with a few friends in coming up with two in-the-making ideas, namely <b>FreeBoh</b>, a social app to find if your friends are currently free, and <b>Together</b>, a private-networking social platform for specific residential areas (which we only found out later that it is similar to the app Neighbor made exclusively for the United States). These ideas were made when we were competing in local hacking events, the former in our campus in Sunway University, and the latter during the AngelHack KL event. I was the main <b>UX and UI Designer</b> for our team of three (for the latter, four).


I enjoy photography as well, and would take down the little places that I see in my camera. I do that most of the time with my DSLR, especially when I travel, which is tricky to actually get it posted to Instagram, where I prefer to keep my public photos. Though there are still times when I would use my phone for shooting.

# Do remind me to leave a few photos here and perhaps around the website so that it will not just be walls of text everywhere!
