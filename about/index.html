### Hi there!

I'm Johnson. Welcome onto my blog called Japorized, a pseunonym that I go by online. And I shall continue to use the name cause it is already my identity, at least in the cyber world.

#### I am a student

I am currently 22, and I am pursuing an undergraduate degree with a major in Pure Mathematics and a minor in Actuarial Science, matriculating at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada. Prior to this, I studied in Sunway University, in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, under the American Degree Transfer Program.

#### I am a pure math major!

I have a passion for mathematics, both in its purest form and some of its applications. I like knowing how things work at its very fundamental, perhaps just to satisfy the forever-unquenchable needs of my inquisitional mind. The way certain problems have been rephrased, solved or proven mathematically by many of our predecessors intrigues me.

I am interested to work in the actuarial field, particularly in its researches, statistical models (e.g. mortality and morbidity), and, to some extent, policy-making. While I have no related experience, aside from some statistical background, I am enthusiastic to get a job in the actuarial field to kickstart my career.

#### I love web programming and designing

I also love programming and designing, especially for the web. I like keeping an eye out at the recent developments of the front-end development news, and get my hands dirty on some of the interesting ideas, frameworks and libraries that I come across. While I love playing around with web development, I prefer to keep it as a pastime hobby.

#### I love photography

I enjoy photography as well, and would take down the little places and items that I catches my eye. I do that most of the time with my DSLR, especially when I travel, which is tricky to actually get it posted to Instagram. Although given my current lifestyle, I use my iPhone 5S as a camera more than I do now with my DSLR.
