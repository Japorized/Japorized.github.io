<center style="font-family: Helvetica;">I am Johnson, and I prefer to be known as Japorized on the web.</center>

I believe the little description under my avatar has covered most of who and what I am, and a few of my interests as well. But nothing beats a little self-introduction.

I am a `Malaysian Chinese`, currently living in `Malaysia`, in a small and quaint town called Taiping, in the state of Perak. Being born in a multiracial and multiethnicity society, I am able to learn a few different languages and tongues, and am now able to communicate in at least 3 different languages and 3 different dialects. I have finished both my primary and secondary education here.

Having just entered my 20s, I am currently pursuing a degree in `Actuarial Science`, and has been enrolled in the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada. I mention myself as "enrolled" as I have yet to attend the school due to some problems with my visa application. Prior to this, I have studied in Sunway University, in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, under the American Degree Transfer Program.

I have a passion for <span title="which explains the f(x) in my description" style="cursor: context-menu">`mathematics`</span>, both in its purest form and its applications. I like knowing how things work at its very fundamentals, perhaps just to satisfy the forever-unquenchable needs of my inquisitional mind.

I also love programming and designing, and I have cooperated with a few friends in coming up with two in-the-making ideas, namely `FreeBoh`, a social app to find if your friends are currently free, and `Together`, a private-networking social platform for specific residential areas (which we only found out later that it is similar to the app Neighbor made exclusively for the United States). These ideas were made when we were competing in local hacking events, the former in our campus in Sunway University, and the latter during the AngelHack KL event. I was the main `UX and UI Designer` for our team of three (for the latter, four).
