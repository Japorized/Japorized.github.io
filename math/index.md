## Personal Math Scribbles

<small>PS: I do not guarantee that my proofs are absolutely correct. They are probably not. These notes here serve to be my personal stash of some of my exercises and revision that I do not wish to discard. Feel free to provide comments.</small>

{% for notes in site.data.mathnotes %}
{{ notes.title }} [view here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url={{ notes.url }})
{% endfor %} 

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/japorized/TeX_notes){:target="_blank"} instead.

Go to [my notes](./notes) on this site instead.
